Abstract The Red Sea is a unique resource whose 
potential remains underutilized. Since the 1980s 
development for mass tourism has destroyed the northern 
coastal stretches as exemplified by the city of Hurghada. A 
number of initiatives have taken place in the past to protect 
areas along the Red Sea (from Marsa Alam city South), 
including introduction of ecotourism and coastal planning 
guidelines by the Red Sea Sustainable Tourism Initiative 
(RSSTI) in 2000-2004. Also, the “Livelihood and Income 
From Environment (LIFE)” program in 2005-2008 
supported implementing pilot projects in national parks to 
demonstrate the appropriate processes. Since 2008, local 
NGOs (e.g; HEPCA) initiated sustainable practices such as 
Solid Waste Management and Mooring Buoys. Despite these 
initiatives, the main obstacles to improved planning and 
development are found to be: (i) lack of coordination within 
the ministry and stakeholders, (ii) lack of contextual design 
relevance to the Red Sea, and (iii) inappropriate land 
subdivisions and development in environmentally vulnerable 
areas. The solutions for such complex problems are 
summarized below: (i) Elevate land use planning above the 
ministry level, (ii) incorporate appropriate planning and 
building education, (iii) mandatory use of Land use 
suitability maps in the region.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
The Red Sea is a unique environment with deserts rich in 
history abutting a sea whose remarkable coral reefs are 
among the best in the world. With its striking environment 
and touristic potential, sunny climate, and short flight 
distance from major population centers in Europe, the 
Egyptian Red Sea coast has tremendous potential for 
economic development and benefits for the nation and region. 
Since this coast was opened to tourism after the Camp David 
Accords of 1978, the number of hotel rooms shot up from 
about 40 in 1980, to about 1890 in 1989 to about 7000 in 
1999, to over 40,000 in 2009 (1). This rapid development 
came with unfortunate impacts on the coast and coral reefs 
(2). 
Most of the coast is flanked by a fringing coral reef, which 
blocks access to deep water (3). Exceptions are the mouths of 
dry streams (wadis), where there are breaks in the fringing 
reef and commonly embayments (marsas) that offer 
anchorage and access to deep water for boats, snorkelling 
opportunities along the reef edge of the embayment, and 
swimming beaches along the landward shore. Thus, the best 
places for tourist resorts are next to marsas, with their access 
to snorkelling and open water. However, development has 
been promoted (by the Tourism Development Authority) on 
parcels evenly distributed along the coast; most sites are 
along fringing reef, where it is impossible to swim in the sea. 
This motivated some developers near Hurghada to physically 
remove the reef in front of their hotels, or to fill over the reef 
in attempts to create direct access to deep water; (4). While 
such blatant destruction is no longer common, development 
patterns along the coast are still not informed by the 
underlying carrying capacity of the coastal geomorphology, 
coastal waters and thus their coral reefs) have been affected 
by chronic pollution and are at risk of extensive 
contamination from flash floods that will scour waste dumps 
in Wadis and carry chemicals, garbage, and other pollutants 
out to the coral reef (5) and (6)
1.2. Objective
This paper aims to analyze exiting institutional structure 
under which development occurs in order to understand the 
points of deficits in the planning process. In addition, 
critically review the environmental planning initiatives that 
have taken place so far and understand their successes and 
failures in order to inform the decision makers of future 
considerations while designing or implementing such 
projects. And inform private developers on best practices to 
consider while working on new development along the 
Egyptian Southern area of the Red Sea coast.

2. Problem Statement
Since the late seventies there has been recognition of the 
environmental significance of the Red Sea area, but attempts 
to do environmental planning started only in the 21st century. 
Developing the Red Sea for economic reasons was mainly 
promoted by the Government of Egypt to create jobs and 
increase national income. However, efforts to implement 
more sustainable, environmental and balanced development 
were initiated by external organizations seeking to protect 
the ecosystem specifically the coral reef, migratory birds and 
mangrove trees, as well as archeological sites. These 
organizations include USAID, UNEP, GEF, IUCN, Italian 
Cooperation, UNDP and WFP. (Table 1)
The earlier projects and initiatives played a role in 
bringing new concepts to the attention of local authorities 
and were the “wake-up” call for the importance of 
sustainable tourism. The most recent projects are the most 
significant ones that took place since the beginning of this 
century. However, none of these initiatives were extremely 
successful in changing the mind set and the pattern of 
operation of the local authorities. The most recent two 
projects namely RSSTI and LIFE had sufficient funding to 
implement pilot examples. The RSSTI project (7) focused on 
the 5 km coastal strip of the Red Sea from Marsa Alam to 
Ras Banas (8), and despite all the land use planning efforts, 
the development continues (business as usual) after the 
project. The most recent project LIFE had some successful 
intervention with local communities’ development and 
supported some infrastructure in the park (e.g. vehicular 
trails, a ranger’s operation center facility, a visitor center and 
marine equipment).
However, none of the projects to date have achieved broad 
public education or developed land use suitability maps at 
appropriate scales to provide guidance for future ecotourism
development for the area.
3. Methods
This research documented and overlapped current national 
and regional strategies that is concerned with the southern 
Red Sea region. In addition, mapped the governmental 
institutions responsible for developing the coast. 
Through interviews with officials in the environmental 
agencies (EEAA), the tourism agencies (TDA) and the local 
governorates (RSG) and in addition to 8 years of experience 
in international development projects in the Red Sea area, the 
exiting framework of development was analyzed. This paper 
highlights areas of potential improvements towards 
improved sustainable tourism planning. In addition, the 
overall scheme of design and planning templates for the 
coast was analyzed. Based on these investigations, a 
comprehensive set of recommendations were put to gather to 
address each of the findings on both the right scale and the 
appropriate institutional level.
4. Findings
Despite the thorough attempts of environmental planning 
agencies, and despite the fact that there is more awareness 
Civil Engineering and Architecture 4(2): 39-46, 2016 41
about environmental planning and ecotourism planning, the 
pattern of land subdivisions remains inappropriate for the 
environment. The reasons can be summarized as follows:
4.1. Current Structure of Government Agencies
The implementing agencies for tourism planning, in 
general, are subordinate agencies to Ministries and have 
specific mandate that often prevent planners from examining 
issues from a multidisciplinary perspective. A national or 
regional planning agency with a broader perspective could 
alleviate this problem. Alternatively, elevating the authority 
(or jurisdiction) of individual planning agencies would also 
encourage multidisciplinary planning perspectives. A 
schematic simplified diagram for the existing ministries and 
some of their executing arms has been shown in figure (1).
The selected ministries and subordinating agencies in 
table 2 are examples of ministries that shape/influence 
development across the country including the development 
of the Red Sea region.
The Tourism Development Authority (TDA) under the 
Ministry of Tourism has a very well-defined mandate, 
consisting of dividing the land, and encouraging developers 
to invest in tourism facilities to increase the number of rooms 
and therefore attract more tourism. They have been 
successful in achieving the target. However, TDA has not 
fully considered its impact on environmental resources and 
fragile ecosystems, so achieving this development was at a 
very high environmental cost.

4.2. Current Methods for Planning & Design
Even within the available small window that international 
organizations promote to introduce some environmental 
planning for such a quality destination, the actual attempts 
have been lacking sufficient information about sustainability. 
The planning process did not recognize the weight of the 
environmental and cultural factors. Although some projects 
had high level of awareness about the appropriate planning, 
this was on the ideas and concept level and was not carried 
out forward to implementation. The typical planning 
techniques adopted further north (which is land subdivisions 
in linear row) has continued to be used in the southern region 
of the Red Sea. (Figure 2)
4.3. Planning & Design Models
The local residents in the area are nomads who move 
across the Red Sea mountain range. Their numbers are small 
and their settling points within this migratory network tend 
to be fresh water wells where they practice grazing, and 
small villages near the shoreline where their main activity is 
fishing. Therefore, their physical traces are less impressive 
than the architecture dominating other parts of Egypt.
Most of the professional planning and design attempts to 
“go-green” have been imported from other climates. While 
perhaps environmentally friendly and useful for their 
original settings, they may not be appropriate for the Red Sea 
coast of Egypt. The following are two examples of this 
practice:
 Copying Nile Valley Development Style
Architects and landscape architects in Egypt are heavily 
influenced by the architecture of the Nile Valley, and have 
drawn upon the vernacular architecture and building 
materials of the Nile for building along the Red Sea. 
However the Nilotic template is not necessarily the most 
appropriate for the Red Sea desert, climate, soil, available 
stone, economic activity and nature of residents. Patterns of 
life in the eastern desert of Egypt are very different and 
would suggest different patterns of planning and design for 
the coast. Figures 2 and 3 show some replication of domes 
and vaults using concrete. (Vaults and domes are originally 
structure forms that are suitable for areas like Nile valley 
where mud bricks and limestone exist).
 Copying Other External Development Style
In attempts to replicate successful examples of world class 
ecotourism, such as South Africa “Ecolodges”, the tendency 
has been to replicate the facility rather than the planning and 
design process, which resulted in, ignoring differences in 
locally available material, climate and other aspects. Figure 4 
shows an example of the building style of one of the camps 
using wood and concrete while the area is rich in other 
material that can be of more use such as granite and gravel.

5. Discussion
TDA’s approach of dividing up coast lands into regularly 
spaced parcels cannot take into account the very different 
context of each land at different parts of the coast. Moreover, 
the TDA’s mandate to develop has been manifested more in 
quantity than quality of tourism (i.e. number of rooms or 
nights versus revenue), resulting in densely developed coasts 
in the northern part of the Red Sea with a very low selling 
rate per room per night (goes as low as 12$/night in charter 
flights packages). This resulted in a mass tourism which 
created stress on environmental assets and significant 
environmental degradation such as developing on landfill, 
destruction of coral reef, pressure on fresh ground water, 
development within flood zones and a reduction in quality of 
the destination. 
International Environmental Planning initiatives have 
achieved little individual successes in areas such as effective 
use of water, grey water recycle, waste disposal, however, 
they most importantly highlight the issue of sustainability 
and bring it to the attention of the Egyptian government as 
well as private developers. 
The current practice of employing the design templates of 
the Nile valley architecture and other global inappropriate 
examples has stifle the development of a building style that is 
in direct conflict with the coastal environmental and cultural 
context. 
The gap between what is implemented in terms of 
sustainability measure and what is envisioned for this region 
remains very big, and both the Egyptian government and the 
international planning initiative shall push sustainable 
development further in the planning process and in the 
implementation of such tourism projects.
6. Recommendations
6.1. Institutional Improvements
 Institutional restructure
It is recommended that planning authorities be elevated 
above the single sector ministries to avoid the current 
conflicts between the Ministry of Tourism (aiming to 
increase tourism development) and the Ministry of 
Environment (aiming to preserve environmental resources). 
Figure 5 shows a proposal to elevate the planning authorities 
above the ministries as agencies that serve one sector 
through formulation of a cross-cutting higher commission 
for planning. This is a proposal developed by “Mithaq 
Group”, a group of professionals representing several 
organizations, and supported by several political parties and
civil society organizations
 Implementation agency mandate
Like any other ministry in Egypt, the Ministry of Tourism 
is supported by many implementing arms such as: Tourism 
Development Authority, Tourism Promotion Agencies and 
others.
It is recommended that the objective of Tourism 
Development authority to be changed from “Mass” tourism, 
where success is evaluated by the number of hotel rooms 
built, to low, moderate or “eco” tourism (achieving more 
number of rooms built) to “Moderate” or “eco” tourism 
(achieving same revenue or more with less number of rooms). 
Figure 7 shows the major difference between current 
planning approaches and alternative concepts:
a) The current parcelization pattern (alternative A) 
44 Sustainable Tourism along the Red Sea: Still Possible?
tends to block natural flooding paths, reduce public 
view of the sea, minimize monitoring and limit 
control over the marine activities
b) Laying out parcels in groups (alternative B) allows 
for floods to flow smoothly without damage, 
guarantees better management, more and beneficial 
environmental monitoring, exclusivity and better 
sustainability for the existing resources
c) Alternative (C) proposes a more integrated and 
exclusive pattern that is economically feasible, safe 
from floods and provides better protection for the 
environment

6.2. Improve Environmental Planning & Design 
Capabilities
(a) Planning Level
The local authority (TDA) responsible for this planning 
will need to conduct a comprehensive research project to 
help identify vulnerability maps to inform other government 
agencies and developers of potential hazards in the region. It 
is also crucial to re-evaluate the planning process for the 
coastal area and incorporate a higher environmental planning 
component. 
Informing the public and the investor of accurate 
potentials and hazards of sites is a key element to shaping the 
development pattern for the region and will help reduce risks 
that may occur to people and investments.
Increasing the technical capabilities for the planning team 
about Integrated Coastal Zone Management, (ICZM) will 
allow them to plan the coastal plain in conjunction and 
proper integration with the mountain deep range of the Red 
Sea, because the ecosystem is interlinked and the coast 
cannot be sub divided in isolation of what is going neither in 
the deep desert (west) nor on the marine side (east).
(b) Design Level
It is important to pay closer attention to the designs 
proposed by project developers and to re-evaluate the entire 
site layout to make sure it falls within the planning principles 
and ecological considerations on the macro scale. This can 
be achieved by revisiting the current Environmental Impact 
Assessment (E.I.A) process for such projects to include 
wider zones than the projects land lot.
One important consideration in tourism planning relate to 
adopting design solutions within the site boundaries, such as 
avoiding building in Wadi floor, using light structural 
development in potential runoff zones and avoiding locating 
facilities in parts of land where there is potential for flooding 
or soil replacement. This requires selecting competent 
landscape designers who are able to understand the site and 
respond to the developer needs without harmful designs that 
end up with environmental disasters.
The environmental regulations and current practices for 
shoreline setback are developed in isolation of risks that may 
occur from shoreline dynamics such as seal level change, 
realization of different habitat basic needs (e.g. turtle nesting 
sites and coastal mangrove zones).
6.3. Improving Education & Learning from Local 
Knowledge
It is recommended to conduct consultation with local 
residents about their experience with ecological factors in the 
area. Such consultation will provide insights to numerous 
factors that might not otherwise be evident during the 
decision making time such as history of previous floods, 
types of winds in other seasons, project impact on local flora 
and network of movement for the fauna system (migratory
birds and camel trail systems). 
This consultation could include a wide range of public 
participation, engaging the nomads in the planning process 
and allowing for a communication channel between the 
developer and local residents in the Red Sea region.
