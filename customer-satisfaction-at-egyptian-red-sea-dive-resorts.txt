Abstract: This research aims to explore the relationship between customer satisfaction and various
extracted factors at dive resorts in the Red Sea, Egypt, utilizing a hybrid methodology of descriptive
and diagnostic analytics applied to online review data. Employing techniques such as KH coder
for text analysis, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and linear regression, this study systematically
identifies key elements that influence customer satisfaction. Findings reveal that activities related to
diving and marine life markedly enhance guest satisfaction, underscoring the critical role these aspects
play in the overall appeal of Egyptian coastal tourism. Conversely, areas such as dining and amenities
were identified as needing improvement. The originality of this study lies in its application of big
data analytics to dissect and understand customer feedback in a sector-specific context, providing
strategic insights for the sustainable advancement of coastal tourism in Egypt. By focusing on dive
resorts, this research highlights their integral role in coastal tourism and offers a model for leveraging
online customer reviews to enhance service quality and promote sustainable practices within the

1. Introduction
Marine diving tourism, a global phenomenon, is a multi-billion-USD industry with
over 6600 diving centers and resorts in 186 countries or territories, as reported by the Professional Association of Diving Instructors [1]. As a major component of the ocean economy,
it attracts between 8.9 and 13.6 million diving tourists globally each year, supporting up to
124,000 jobs [2]. This sector has grown rapidly, mirroring broader trends in coastal tourism.
However, the high market demand and rapid development have created challenges in
maintaining service quality.
The Egyptian Red Sea, renowned for its rich natural and cultural resources, is a
premier diving destination that significantly contributes to Egypt’s tourism strategy [3].
Seventy-five percent of Egypt’s tourism activities are leisure-oriented, focusing on the
Sinai Peninsula and the Red Sea, generating substantial revenue from its approximately
1386 km coastline [4]. The region’s vibrant coral reefs attract millions of tourists, leading to
significant ‘blue tourism’ development since the early 1990s, including a surge in hotels
and accommodation facilities. The hospitality industry in Egypt has undergone significant
transformation, particularly in the context of seaside-oriented tourism. Major coastal

cities like Sharm El Sheikh, Hurghada, and Marsa Alam collectively account for over
110,000 rooms, nearly 60% of the country’s total room capacity [5].
Despite the pandemic, Egypt’s tourism sector continues to grow and show resilience.
In 2023, Egypt’s tourism revenues grew by 8% year-on-year to USD 13.2 billion, with tourist
arrivals increasing by 27.4% to 14.91 million [6]. Tourists spent an average of USD 93 per day
and stayed for 9.5 nights. Egypt expects to attract 18 million tourists in 2024. The country
also aims to boost annual tourism revenues from USD 12 billion to USD 30 billion over the
next three years [7]. The Egyptian Red Sea coast, as a major tourist destination, attracts
millions of tourists annually, generating billions of USD in foreign exchange and creating
numerous job opportunities [8]. However, the rapid expansion of coastal tourism has led
to challenges such as environmental degradation, coral reef damage, and coastal pollution,
threatening sustainability [9]. Overcrowding and resource strain complicate destination
management [5]. To enhance coastal tourism destination management, dive resorts, as a
crucial part of coastal tourism, play a key role in promoting sustainable development by
improving service quality and customer satisfaction.
Digitization has made social media and internet search engines key sources of travel
information, with about half of prospective tourists using social media to plan their vacations [10]. Big data analytics in hospitality facilitates extensive review analysis, providing
insights into customer preferences and satisfaction to inform sustainable strategic decisions [11].
While many studies link customer ratings to satisfaction in hotels [11–13], specific
research on coastal hotels, particularly dive resorts, is limited. Given the multifaceted
nature of coastal tourism, focusing on dive resorts is crucial to enhance understanding
and improve customer satisfaction. Existing research on coastal tourism primarily addresses environmentally sustainable tourism [14,15], climate change [16,17], and market
segmentation [18,19]. There is a significant gap in research on how dive resorts enhance
customer satisfaction and achieve sustainable development in coastal tourism, highlighting
the necessity for in-depth analysis and empirical studies in this field.
Therefore, this study aims to investigate the relationship between the extracted factors
and customer satisfaction at dive resorts through a combination of descriptive and diagnostic analytics applied to online review data. This research provides valuable insights for
the sustainable development of Egypt’s Red Sea coastal tourism. Specifically, this study
employs KH coder for text analysis and exploratory factor analysis (EFA), followed by
linear regression analysis to determine the significant factors affecting customer satisfaction.
The findings will enable dive resort operators to identify key attributes that can enhance
customer satisfaction, improve operational efficiency, inform marketing strategies, and
contribute to the success of coastal tourism in a highly competitive tourism industry. In
conclusion, this study attempts to address the following research questions by exploring
knowledge and insights from online customer reviews of dive resorts:
• What key terms in online reviews best capture customers’ experiences at dive resorts,
and what are the connections between these terms?
• Which underlying factors influencing customer experiences at dive resorts can be
identified through online reviews?
• How do the identified factors impact overall customer satisfaction at dive resorts, and
to what extent does each factor contribute?
2. Theoretical Background
2.1. The Definition and Relationship of Coastal Tourism and Dive Resorts
Coastal tourism, as defined by the United Nations World Tourism Organization
(UNWTO), includes a variety of land-based activities such as swimming, surfing, sunbathing, and other leisure, recreation, and sports activities that take place along the shores
of seas, lakes, or rivers. The essential element is the proximity to the coastline, which
supports the development of related services and facilities like hotels, restaurants, and
Tour. Hosp. 2024, 5 998
marinas [20]. This diverse array of recreation and leisure activities attracts tourists to coastal
areas, fostering economic growth and the development of local infrastructure [21].
Dive resorts are specialized businesses that integrate accommodation with diving activities, providing scuba diving services for both certified and non-certified divers through
associations such as SDI (Scuba Diving International), SSI (Scuba Schools International),
and PADI [22]. Unlike conventional accommodation, dive resorts feature on-site dive
centers where guests can rent equipment, arrange boat trips to dive sites, and enroll in
scuba diving courses conducted by trained staff or instructors [23]. In addition to diving
services, these resorts offer a range of amenities and leisure activities, such as swimming
pools, spas, beach access, restaurants, bars, and organized social events [22]. Dive resorts
serve as central hubs for diving enthusiasts, providing comprehensive services to ensure a
comfortable and immersive holiday experience.
Dive resorts significantly contribute to facilitating coastal tourism. The relationship
between coastal tourism and dive resorts is symbiotic. Coastal tourism provides the overarching framework within which dive resorts operate, as a thriving coastal tourism industry
creates a conducive environment for their success. Dive resorts, in turn, enhance the appeal
of coastal destinations by offering unique underwater experiences that attract specific
interest groups, thereby driving infrastructure development and promoting environmental
conservation efforts [24]. This mutual enhancement is essential for the sustainable growth
of both sectors. Addressing environmental challenges such as degradation and pollution
through sustainable practices is crucial to ensuring the long-term viability of coastal tourism
and dive resorts [25]. Therefore, comprehensive research focused on the specific impacts
and potential of dive resorts within coastal tourism is necessary for understanding and
maximizing their benefits to local economies and communities.
2.2. The Definition and Relationship of Customer Satisfaction and Online Reviews
Satisfaction depends on individual expectations and subjective perceptions of service
performance, with consumers evaluating service providers based on personal experiences [26,27]. Research indicates that satisfied customers are more likely to become loyal
patrons, with a crucial impact on profitability and continuity of the organizations [28]. Furthermore, positive word-of-mouth recommendations from satisfied customers can attract
new clients and enhance brand reputation [29].
Customer satisfaction in tourism is influenced by various factors, such as the quality
of products or services [30] and perceived value [31]. High-quality offerings and a sense
of fair value for money are fundamental to increasing customer satisfaction. Additionally,
interactions with employees play a significant role in shaping customer experiences [32].
Other factors such as convenience, reliability, and responsiveness to complaints or queries
also impact customer satisfaction [33].
In tourism, online reviews and sentiments play a key role in shaping tourists’ decisions
as people increasingly rely on the Internet for information [34]. These reviews, which
typically consist of written comments or ratings, are available on websites, social media,
and online marketplaces [12]. Online reviews can significantly influence potential buyers’
perceptions of brands and their purchase decisions. Positive reviews can enhance a brand’s
reputation and credibility [35], while negative reviews may deter potential customers from
engaging with a particular product or service [36].
In a digitally driven world, customer satisfaction and online reviews have become crucial factors in determining the success of a business. In the tourism industry, these reviews
serve as a medium for sharing experiences and recommending destinations [37]. The proliferation of social media and online review sites has empowered customers, significantly
influencing company reputations through feedback.
The relationship between customer satisfaction and online reviews is multifaceted.
Ratings offer a quick quantitative measure of satisfaction, while reviews provide qualitative
insights into specific experiences. Together, they offer a fuller picture by quantifying
satisfaction levels and explaining the reasons behind them, helping businesses identify
Tour. Hosp. 2024, 5 999
areas of strength and improvement. In many studies, review ratings are directly regarded
as indicators of customer satisfaction [38,39].
2.3. What Is Big Data Analysis?
Digitalization has accelerated the demand for ecosystems in the tourism and hospitality industries to restructure business models in a data-driven direction to foster value
creation and innovation [40]. The amount of data generated continues to grow exponentially, making it a critical field in recent years [41]. Big data analysis refers to extracting
valuable insights from large and complex datasets [42]. Tourism and hospitality researchers
are increasingly adopting big data approaches to retrieving, collecting, analyzing, reporting,
and visualizing data [43]. Big Data encompasses huge datasets that challenge traditional
data processing tools in management, processing, and analysis. These datasets originate
from numerous sources and are distinguished by three key characteristics: volume (the
sheer amount of data), velocity (the rapid rate at which data are generated and processed),
and variety (the range of data types, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data) [42]. It involves various techniques such as data mining, machine learning, and
statistical modeling [44].
In the context of the hotel industry, it involves analyzing vast amounts of customerrelated information collected through various sources such as online bookings, social media
interactions, loyalty programs, and customer feedback. By analyzing customer preferences
and behavior patterns derived from big data analytics, hotels can offer personalized services
tailored to individual customers’ needs [13].
Based on previous studies, big data analytics encompasses four main types: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. Descriptive analytics focuses on
analyzing past data to understand what has happened. Diagnostic analytics digs deeper
into data to determine the causes of past events. Predictive analytics employs statistical
models and machine learning to forecast future outcomes. Lastly, prescriptive analytics
suggests actions and advises on potential outcomes to achieve specific objectives. These
analytic types offer a comprehensive approach to data analysis, from understanding past
events to planning future actions [45,46].
3. Methodology
3.1. Study Design
The research process was designed in two steps: data collection and data analysis, as
shown in Figure 1. The purpose of the analysis was to examine the relationship between
the extracted factors and customer satisfaction of dive resorts by analyzing the online
review data.
Figure 1. Research flow (source: authors).
Tour. Hosp. 2024, 5 1000
3.2. Data Collection
This research is based on an exploratory study of online reviews from nine of the best
Red Sea dive resorts by PADI recommended in 2022 [47]. The nine dive resorts are Reef
Oasis Blue Bay Resort, Umbi Sharks Bay Diving Village, Reef Oasis Beach Resort, Maritim
Jolie Ville Resort & Casino Sharm El Sheikh, Cataract Layalina Resort, Desert Rose Resort,
Marsa Shagra Village, Abu Dabbi Lodge, and Hilton Marsa Alam Nubian Resort.
The online reviews were collected from Google Maps using Outscraper 2024, an online
API data mining software, as used in previous research [48]. The collected data included
multilingual online review texts, numerical ratings, and additional information such as user
names, upload times, emotion icons, and photographs. Due to the pandemic, there has been
an increasing interest in new activities and attractions, leading to a rise in the popularity of
various leisure activities [49]. With that, this study collected a total of 18,428 online reviews
from November 2020 to November 2023, which were posted by customers within the last
three years.
For data pre-processing, from a total of 18,428 reviews, around 25% of reviews without
any text were removed, and the remaining 75% of the reviews, including review text and
ratings, were retained for analysis. These reviews removed irrelevant information such
as Google ID, review link, review ID, author ID, author image, and other non-essential
elements. The language of each review was identified using automatic language detection
tools. Non-English reviews were translated into English using translation services to
transform unstructured data into a structured format. KH Coder, a text-mining tool, was
then used to eliminate stop words for more meaningful results. Consequently, after data
pre-processing, 13,905 online textual reviews were analyzed.
Copyright and data privacy requirements: As per the relevant local legislation in
South Korea, ethical approval and informed consent were not required for this study. All
necessary steps were taken to ensure compliance with copyright and privacy requirements.
The online reviews were collected from Google Maps, and we followed the guidelines of
Google Maps. The data utilized in this research fully adhered to the applicable legal and
ethical standards, and no personally identifiable information was disclosed.
3.3. Data Analysis
First, the descriptive analytics process in this study utilized KH Coder to extract the top
100 frequent words, group similar appearance patterns together, and visualize the relations
between these words. KH Coder 3.0 is a software designed for organizing, analyzing,
and understanding digitized text data through computer coding and quantitative analysis
techniques [50]. Co-occurrence network analysis is employed to explore and visualize the
relationships between entities within a dataset based on their simultaneous occurrence in
the same context, such as a sentence, paragraph, or document. A co-occurrence network
was created with the review ratings, and sentiment groups are visualized to identify
distinctive words in each group [51].
Second, for the process of diagnostic analytics, exploratory factor analysis (EFA)
and linear regression analysis were carried out using SPSS 26.0. EFA is a data reduction
technique used to simplify complex customer review data and to understand the variables
contributing to overall customer satisfaction [52]. Linear regression indicates the strength
and direction of the relationship between each independent variable and overall satisfaction
scores [11]. The analysis helps to understand which factors from the online reviews
significantly contribute to or influence customer satisfaction.
4. Results
4.1. Descriptive Analytics
The data collection includes review ratings and review text for the analysis. Ratings
from Google Maps serve as a crucial metric for gauging customer satisfaction. Each review
is assigned a score on a scale from ‘1’ to ‘5’, with ‘1’ indicating the least satisfied reviewer
and ‘5’ representing the most satisfied reviewer [53,54]. This numerical representation
Tour. Hosp. 2024, 5 1001
provides a straightforward method to assess and quantify overall satisfaction levels based
on customer feedback.
The distribution of the star ratings, which follows a J-shape, is shown in Figure 2. The
review rating frequency indicates that the dive resort has received predominantly positive
feedback. The average satisfaction score is 4.6 out of 5, with the majority of customers
(79.3%) awarding a 5-star rating. Negative reviews are minimal, with only 2.8% and 1.6%
of customers giving 1-star and 2-star ratings, respectively. Ratings of 3 stars and 4 stars are
also relatively low, indicating that while most customers are highly satisfied, a few have
experienced minor issues. This distribution suggests high overall customer satisfaction and
implies that the resorts are likely to maintain a strong positive reputation. However, it is
important to pay attention to the lower ratings to identify potential areas for improvement.

4.1.1. Word Frequency Analysis
The analysis of the top 100 frequent words is laid out as shown in Table 1. The word
‘hotel’ emerges as the most frequently mentioned, with 9049 occurrences, and ‘resort’ (1316)
indicates that accommodation is a principal factor in customers’ experiences. This indicates
that resorts serve as a foundation for the coastal tourism experience. Substantial mentions
of ‘room’ (4267) and ‘beach’ (3785) suggest that the quality of lodging and proximity to
the beach are paramount to coastal tourism customers. Dining (‘food’, ‘restaurant’) and
customer service (‘staff’, ‘service’, ‘friendly’) are crucial to customer experiences.
Notably, ‘diving’ (1257), the main activity associated with the Red Sea coastal tourism
offering, ranks highly in frequency, emphasizing its significance in the Red Sea coastal
tourism and reaffirming the resorts’ importance as a dive-related destination. The mention
of ‘sea’, ‘reef’, ‘water’, ‘fish’, and ‘coral’ underscores the importance of the marine environment to the customers’ overall coastal tourism experience. Words such as ‘animation’,
‘entertainment’, ‘show’, and ‘activity’ reflect the leisure activities offered by the resorts and
their significance in customer satisfaction. While most of the frequent words are positive,
terms such as ‘problem’, ‘bad’, ‘old’, and ‘small’ highlight areas of customer concern,
suggesting room for improvement in certain aspects of the resort experience.

4.1.2. Co-Occurrence Network Analysis
The co-occurrence network derived from the analysis of online reviews, depicted in
Figure 3, illustrates the multifaceted and interconnected nature of the tourist experience
in coastal tourism. Key themes identified include ‘hotel’, ‘beach’, ‘room’, ‘food’, ‘staff’,
‘service’, and ‘clean’. These terms form central nodes with the highest frequency and
co-occurrence with other terms, highlighting their importance to many customers.
Figure 3. Co-occurrence network result.
Tour. Hosp. 2024, 5 1003
This network shows that coastal tourism is holistic, with various interlinked elements
contributing to tourists’ satisfaction. Terms like ‘coral’, ‘reef’, ‘sea’, ‘fish’, and ‘diving’
underscore the significance of marine life and diving activities in the Red Sea region. These
elements work synergistically with other aspects to enhance the coastal tourism experience.
Positive words like ‘beautiful’, ‘excellent’, and ‘friendly’ highlight the crucial role of
the natural environment and quality customer service. Additionally, terms related to meals,
such as ‘breakfast’, ‘lunch’, ‘dinner’, ‘restaurant’, and ‘food’, emphasize the importance of
food services in the overall resort experience.
The analysis reveals that every aspect, from accommodation and food to the marine
environment and customer service, is interconnected and indispensable. Each element supports the others, creating a comprehensive and satisfying coastal tourism experience. This
holistic approach ensures that any weakness in one area could impact overall satisfaction,
highlighting the need for an integrated and high-quality offering across all facets of the
tourist experience.
4.1.3. Co-Occurrence Network Analysis with Rating
The co-occurrence rating figure, which can be found in Figure 4, shows that the Red
Sea coastal tourism reviews indicate a diverse range of experiences, with ratings from 1
(most disappointed) to 5 (most satisfied). The data point towards a polarity in customer
experiences, with significant words associated with high and low ratings.
Figure 4. Co-occurrence network analysis with rating.
The highest satisfaction ratings (5) co-occur with words like ‘wonderful’, ‘super’, ‘best’,
‘delicious’, ‘excellent’, ‘beautiful’, ‘friendly’, ‘great’, ‘amazing’, and ‘vacation’, alongside
central coastal tourism-related terms such as ‘resort’, ‘diving’, ‘reef’, ‘beach’, ‘sea’, and
‘hotel’. The second-highest satisfaction rating (4) is associated with ‘good’, ‘service’, ‘place’,
‘food’, and ‘staff’, indicating that these aspects are satisfactory to customers but may not
reach the highest levels of acclaim.
Neutral experiences (3) show with words like ‘bar’, ‘restaurant’, and ‘room’, where
a customer feels neither particularly satisfied nor dissatisfied. Lower satisfaction levels
(2) include words like ‘money’ and ‘poor’, suggesting issues with value for money or
unmet expectations. The lowest rating (1) is associated with highly negative terms such
as ‘terrible’, ‘dirty’, ‘bad’, ‘old’, and ‘reception’, indicating areas of critical concern for
some customers.

4.2. Diagnostic Analytics
4.2.1. Exploratory Factor Analysis
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to explore the underlying structure
among the keywords extracted from online reviews of a dive resort. The objective was to
reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by grouping variables into factors based on their
correlations [55]. Initially, 34 keywords extracted from word frequency analysis and cooccurrence network analysis were utilized for conducting EFA using SPSS 26.0. The criteria
for inclusion in the final model were factor loadings of 0.4 and above with eigenvalues
greater than 1.0, ensuring that each factor significantly contributes to explaining variance
within the data. Any factors that loaded into two variables concomitantly were removed to
maintain clear factor interpretation.
The results, as presented in Table 2, show the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) measure
stands at 0.807, surpassing the commonly recommended threshold of 0.6, corroborating
the adequacy of the data for factor analysis [56]. Bartlett’s test of sphericity confirms the
intercorrelations within the dataset with a chi-square value of 39,292.512 and a significance
level below 0.001, indicating that the variables have enough in common to justify the use
of EFA. This provides evidence against the data being an identity matrix and supports its
suitability for the applied factor analysis.

Finally, based on the EFA results, nine words were eliminated since they did not pass
the factor loading standard of 0.4. As a result, 25 words from the seven factors accounting
for 44.528% of all variances were used as independent variables to derive key factors
reflecting customer experience. This study measured reliability through the Cronbach’s
alpha value. Cronbach’s alpha was derived from SPSS to assess the reliability of the factors
derived from the online reviews. This value indicates the internal consistency of the items
Tour. Hosp. 2024, 5 1005
within each factor, demonstrating that the factors are reliable and meet the accepted criteria
for reliability analysis. The Cronbach’s alpha value in this study shows 0.730, greater than
0.7, indicating good internal consistency [57].
The factors identified encompass various aspects of the resort experience, including
‘Resort’, ‘Diving’, ‘Amenities’, ‘Outdoor Space’, ‘Entertainment’, ‘Dining’, and ‘Service’.
4.2.2. Linear Regression Analysis
Following the EFA, seven factors were used as independent variables in a linear regression model to assess their impact on customer rating, also called ‘customer satisfaction’
in this study. The results of linear regression analysis are shown in Table 3. Various factors
were assessed for their impact on overall customer satisfaction ratings for a resort, with the
model indicating a baseline satisfaction rating of 4.6.

Notes. Dependent variable: customer satisfaction.
Five factors were found to be statistically significant in satisfaction. However, only
one factor showed a positive effect on satisfaction. The diving (β = 0.026, p < 0.05) factor
indicated that diving experiences enhance customer satisfaction. The other four factors,
including resort (β = −0.033, p < 0.001), amenities (β = −0.089, p < 0.001), outdoor space
(β = −0.019, p < 0.05), and dining (β = −0.111, p < 0.001) factors, had negative effects on
satisfaction, suggesting that aspects within these categories might detract from customers’
satisfaction levels. Particularly, dining and amenities had a significant negative impact,
hinting at the need for improvements in the resort’s breakfast, dinner, and swimming
pool aspects to boost satisfaction. In addition, entertainment (β = 0.016, p = 0.064) and
service factor (β = 0.013, p = 0.126) were not statistically significant, although they had a
positive coefficient.
The results highlight the complexity of customer satisfaction and guide targeted
improvement strategies, identifying key areas for further investigation. The regression
equation based on standardized β is

5. Discussion
In the digital era, big data revolutionizes the coastal tourism industry by analyzing
online reviews to understand customer behavior and preferences, improving operational
efficiency, customer satisfaction, and competitive advantage, leading to loyalty and growth.
This study applies analytics to online customer reviews, utilizing descriptive and diagnostic
analytics to explore the key factors that reflect the customer experience at dive resorts and
their relationship with customer satisfaction.
In the descriptive analytics phase using KH Coder, frequently occurring terms like
‘hotel’, ‘room’, ‘food’, ‘staff’, and ‘service’ in textual reviews were analyzed to visualize their
connections and impact on ratings. This analysis confirmed previous findings, highlighting
their importance on customer experiences [13,58]. The data reflect that dive resorts in the
Tour. Hosp. 2024, 5 1006
Red Sea are not merely places of stay but pivotal to the holistic coastal tourism experience.
The frequent occurrence of ‘diving’ along with ‘reef’, ‘sea’, ‘water’, and ‘fish’ underscores
the centrality of diving activities to the coastal tourism offering in the Red Sea. This aligns
with the study of Spalding et al. [59], which emphasized coral reefs as major draws for
dive tourists, suggesting that the emphasis on marine life can enhance marketing and
conservation efforts.
Consistent with previous studies [60,61], positive descriptors such as ‘good’, ‘great’,
‘delicious’, ‘excellent’, and ‘friendly’ show customer satisfaction. Conversely, terms like
‘dirty’, ‘terrible’, ‘worst’, ‘same’, ‘old’, ‘bad’, and ‘poor’ reflect areas where expectations
are not met [62]. This dualism is a reminder of the constant need for renovation and
attention to detail in service provision and a theme echoed in the study of Jeong and
Oh [63], who advocate for continuous quality improvement in the hospitality industry to
improve satisfaction. Big data analysis of customer reviews can effectively identify specific
areas that businesses need to focus on or improve [64].
The diagnostic analytics phase, utilizing SPSS 26.0, identifies key components of the
resort experience impacting customer satisfaction. ‘Diving’ is highlighted as a distinct
factor with a positive correlation to customer satisfaction. This reflects the central value
proposition of the dive resort and suggests that high-quality diving experiences are integral
to customer contentment. Reviews such as ‘The beach is nearby with turtles and corals
accessible in diving’ and ‘The best thing about the hotel is the location’. There is a coral reef
on the hotel’s own beach. The diving and marine vegetation is outstanding’ underline this.
‘Entertainment’ and ‘service’ factors show a positive correlation with customer satisfaction but are not statistically significant in the model. This suggests that while better
entertainment and service tend to increase satisfaction, the relationship is not strong enough
to be conclusive [65]. Customer comments indicate satisfaction with these aspects, but
issues in other areas, like outdated accommodations, negatively impact overall satisfaction.
For example, comments include the following: ‘Activities are offered. What is boring is,
unfortunately, the show every evening’, ‘Cool animators but the animation programme is
weak’, and ‘Impeccable service but a little dated room’. This highlights the interconnected
nature of customer satisfaction.
Conversely, factors such as ‘resort’, ‘amenities’, ‘outdoor space’, and ‘dining’ negatively correlate with customer satisfaction, highlighting gaps between expectations and
current offerings. These areas need improvement, particularly staff attitude, room cleanliness, food menu, swimming pool environment, green areas, evening entertainment, and
overall service level. Negative feedback includes comments like ‘rooms not good and old’,
‘poor quality of food’, ‘loud party music at the beach and pool’, ‘small and dirty swimming
pool’, ‘no green spaces’, and ‘food is almost the same from breakfast to dinner’.
These findings highlight the intricate relationship between resort features and customer satisfaction in coastal tourism along the Egyptian Red Sea. Management should
prioritize improving areas of dissatisfaction, such as ‘dining’ and ‘amenities’, while maintaining the strengths identified in positive reviews, like diving activities and service quality.
Investments guided by guest feedback can significantly enhance overall satisfaction and
the resort’s reputation.
Protecting the coastal environment, a priority outlined in Egyptian government policies and initiatives like the Egypt Environmental Policy Program (EEPP), is essential for
maintaining the area’s appeal to tourists [66]. Sustainable tourism practices should balance
environmental preservation with the provision of necessary infrastructure and comfortable
accommodations, as these are crucial for tourist satisfaction. This approach aligns with
the goals of preserving the natural beauty and biodiversity of the Red Sea, which are
significant attractions for visitors. By fostering both environmental sustainability and high
tourist satisfaction, resorts can contribute to the sustainable advancement of Egypt’s coastal
tourism industry.

6. Conclusions
6.1. Implications
This study makes a significant contribution to the theoretical literature on dive resorts
by underscoring the necessity to expand traditional service quality models to incorporate unique elements pertinent to dive resorts, such as the quality of dive experiences
and the preservation of natural reefs. The findings suggest that specific terms like ‘reef’
and ‘fish’ represent niche aspects of service quality that are not adequately captured in
generic models [67,68]. This observation supports the theoretical proposition that environmental factors play a crucial role in influencing consumer satisfaction with coastal
tourism. The condition of natural resources, such as coral reefs, is intrinsically linked to
the satisfaction derived from diving experiences, indicating a theoretical linkage between
environmental sustainability and service quality [69]. By integrating these unique elements
into service quality models, dive resorts can enhance their offerings and better meet the
specific needs of coastal tourism tourists, thereby promoting both customer satisfaction
and environmental conservation.
Moreover, customer feedback expressing appreciation for natural beauty and ecological preservation indicates that environmental sustainability should be a core component of
theoretical models in coastal tourism. Expanding these models to include sustainability
metrics can guide resorts in aligning their services with eco-conscious consumer expectations. The balance between exploitation and conservation in service provision can offer
a new dimension to these models [70]. Finally, this research demonstrates the value of
integrating big data from online reviews into the theoretical framework of consumer satisfaction. It highlights how consumer-generated data can provide nuanced insights into
customer expectations and experiences [71].
This study not only contributes theoretically but also to field experts. The first implication for the dive resort operators and managers is that the high frequency of diving-related
terms in the reviews (e.g., ‘diving’, ‘reef’, ‘fish’) highlights the central role of diving in
customer satisfaction. Resort management should ensure the provision of high-quality
diving experiences, including the upkeep of equipment, the availability of skilled dive
instructors, and the preservation of local reefs. To further enhance customer experiences,
managers might consider leveraging partnerships with local conservation groups to emphasize the resort’s commitment to environmental stewardship. Secondly, the negative
coefficient for dining in the regression analysis suggests room for improvement. Managerial
efforts could be directed towards diversifying the menu, ensuring food quality, providing
good dining experiences that meet customers’ expectations, and seeking a premium resort
experience [72]. Third, the analysis points to amenities like ‘swimming’, ‘pool’, and ‘green’
areas as significant factors. Investments should be made to maintain and improve these
facilities. In addition, the area’s natural beauty (e.g., ‘beach’, ‘sea’) is a key attraction,
underscoring the need for environmental stewardship and sustainable practices [73].
Fourth, with ‘service’ emerging as a frequently mentioned term, exceptional service
is vital to customer perceptions. Management should prioritize staff training, with a
focus on customer engagement and service excellence, to maintain high levels of customer
satisfaction [74]. Fifth, cleanliness has emerged as a significant concern in both the frequency
and factor analysis. Regular maintenance and ensuring high standards of cleanliness should
be a priority to keep customer satisfaction levels high [75,76]. Leveraging technology, such
as automated cleaning systems or mobile apps that allow guests to report cleanliness issues
directly, can help maintain and monitor cleanliness more efficiently.
Sixth, terms like ‘entertainment’ and ‘show’ have been identified in the factor analysis.
Although the β in the regression analysis is insignificant, this should not diminish their
value. Enhancing these offerings could serve as a distinct way to set the resort apart
from competitors and elevate the customer experience [77,78]. Seventh, the continuous
analysis of big data should be a top priority for managers, as it offers valuable insights for
operational and marketing strategies and aids in predicting customer needs [79,80]. Swiftly
addressing negative feedback is a critical aspect of maintaining customer satisfaction.

6.2. Limitations and Future Studies
While this study offers valuable insights into coastal tourism, it also has certain
limitations that future research should consider. First, the findings from dive resorts in
the Red Sea area of Egypt may not be generalizable to other dive resorts with different
environmental conditions, management practices, or customer demographics. Secondly,
this study relies exclusively on online reviews, which may not represent the full spectrum
of customer experiences. Online feedback often skews towards extreme views, either highly
positive or highly negative, potentially omitting moderate perspectives that could provide
a more balanced understanding.
